    Hides actor-internal details behind clean method calls so that

    event subscriptions without knowing the underlying tier implementation.

    Implementations: LocalTeamHandle (community), RemoteTeamHandle (department/enterprise).

    Error contract:
        - ``send()`` / ``send_to()`` raise ``ValueError`` if the team is no
          longer running (handle points to a dead team).
        - ``process_human_input()`` raises ``ValueError`` if the team's
          HumanProxy agent cannot be found or the team is not running.
        - ``subscribe()`` / ``unsubscribe()`` are best-effort — if the
          orchestrator has already stopped, they may silently fail.

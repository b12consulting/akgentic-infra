    """Creates a team on a selected worker instance and returns a handle.

    Encapsulates worker selection and team creation so that ``TeamService``
    never needs to know about ``TeamManager`` or actor internals.

    Worker selection semantics vary by tier:

    - **Community** (``LocalPlacement``): single-process — always places on the
      local ``TeamManager`` instance. No network involved.
    - **Department** (``LeastTeamsPlacement``): selects the worker with the fewest
      active teams via ``ServiceRegistry``. Creates the team with an HTTP call
      to the chosen worker's management endpoint.
    - **Enterprise** (``LabelMatchPlacement`` / ``WeightedPlacement`` /
      ``ZoneAwarePlacement``): label-aware selection with optional zone affinity.
      Creates via Dapr service invocation or direct gRPC.

    Error contract:
        Raises ``RuntimeError`` if no healthy worker is available or team
        creation fails on the selected worker. Callers must not retry
        automatically — surface the error to the user.

"""LocalEventStream — community-tier in-memory EventStream with per-reader signaling.

Provides a thread-safe, in-process event stream backed by a plain dict.
Designed for single-process community deployments where no external
infrastructure (Redis, Kafka) is available.

Threading model (CPython GIL assumption):
- One ``threading.Lock`` (``_lock``) on the ``LocalEventStream`` protects
  the ``_streams`` dict during ``append()``, ``subscribe()``, ``remove()``.
- One ``threading.Lock`` per ``_TeamStream`` protects its ``signals`` set
  and ``closed`` flag.
- ``read_next()`` is lock-free during replay: CPython's GIL guarantees
  atomic ``list.append()`` and ``len()``, so a reader whose cursor is
  behind the write frontier can safely index into ``events`` without
  holding any lock. The reader only blocks on its own ``threading.Event``
  when fully caught up.
- Safe for concurrent use from FastAPI thread-pool executors.

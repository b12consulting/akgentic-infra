"""TelemetrySubscriber — shared event subscriber that traces messages via logfire.

Actor-thread contract (see ADR-018):

    ``on_message`` runs on the orchestrator's actor thread and MUST NOT perform
    blocking I/O. Subscribers that need to emit to remote systems must queue
    off-thread, following the pattern in ``TelemetrySubscriber``.

Violating this contract stalls the orchestrator's message loop, which in turn
stalls every downstream consumer (WebSocket replay, live streaming, future
subscribers). ADR-018 Decision 1 (shipped here) makes ``TelemetrySubscriber``
non-blocking internally via a daemon worker thread. ADR-018 Decision 2 (the
orchestrator-level dispatch fix) is deferred to a follow-up epic in
``akgentic-core``.

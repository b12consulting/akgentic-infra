"""FastAPI application factory for the akgentic-infra server.

Per ADR-023: the ``/admin/catalog/*`` HTTP surface IS the v2 unified router
(``akgentic.catalog.api.router.build_router``) with ``AuthStrategy`` wired
as a FastAPI dependency. The v1-shaped ``admin_catalog`` router is gone; the
catalog package itself owns request/response validation, error mapping, and
CRUD semantics. Infra owns only the mount point, the auth gate, and the
structured mutation log middleware.

"""Integration tests -- EventStream population during team lifecycle.

AC5: stream populated during normal operation
AC6: stream repopulated during team restore
AC7: stream removed on team stop (via on_stop when orchestrator shuts down)
AC8: stream removed on team delete (safety net in TeamService.delete_team)

Uses smoke fixtures (TestModel) -- no OPENAI_API_KEY required.

NOTE on on_stop() behavior:
TeamManager._teardown_team() UNSUBSCRIBES shared subscribers before stopping
the orchestrator, so the orchestrator's on_stop() does NOT propagate to shared
subscribers for individual team stops. The EventStreamSubscriber.on_stop() is
invoked during full process shutdown. For individual team lifecycle, stream
cleanup relies on TeamService.delete_team()'s explicit event_stream.remove().
